          <h1>NEIGHBORHOOD</h1>
            <h5>One of my favorite areas that I often frequent is not necessarily an exact <p>
              <p>area at all. It is instead a collection of slightly distant locations that <p>
              <p>are all tied to the same memory. All of these places were the most visited <p>
              <p>locations between me and my boyfriend when we first met. They are all <p>
              <p>relatively in the same place, that being a mix between Walnut Creek and <p>
              <p>Pleasant Hill. My boyfriend and I are long distance during the school year <p>
              <p>so whenever I miss him, I find it therapeutic to take myself on a driving <p>
              <p>tour around these areas to put my mind and heart at ease. Every one of <p>
              <p>these locations will probably always hold powerful memories of time spent <p>
              <p>with him, which may prove unfortunate when (if! lol…) we break up, but for <p>
              <p>now is very comforting and kind of cute.<p></h5>

              <h6><p>Larkey Park is a park located in the backstreets of Walnut Creek bordering<p>
                  <p>on Pleasant Hill. It has a swimming poll, play structure, and picnic area.<p>
                  <p>My boyfriend and I would walk his dog around here at night when we should<p>
                  <p>have just gone home but wanted an excuse/space to keep hanging out.<p></h6>

              <h6><p>Safeway, as I'm sure you all know, is a chain grocery store in Northern<p>
                  <p>California. This specific Safeway is open 24 hours so it was perfect for<p>
                  <p>picking up late night snacks before driving out of town or ice cream at 4 AM<p>
                  <p>on a first date. The bathrooms are pretty nasty, though. Would not recommend<p>
                  <p>for any potty breaks unless it's an absolute emergency.<p></h6>

              <h6><p>A hidden pho restaurant in downtown Walnut Creek that I admitedly have only<p>
                  <p>eaten at twice. And only one of those times was with my boyfriend. But it holds<p>
                  <p>significance because it's the restaurant he would always go to with his mom and<p>
                  <p>hadn't brought anybody else there before. We went after I gave him a hair cut<p>
                  <p>which looked super good despite him saying otherwise.<p></h6>

              <h6><p>Mixed Grain is a Korean cuisine restaurant that we eat at a lot. My <p>
                  <p>favorite thing to order is Soondubu, or soft tofu stew (extra spicy and <p>
                  <p>with seafood). It is a fairly popular spot to eat that’s located in downtown <p>
                  <p>Walnut Creek. I don’t only visit this restaurant with my boyfriend, my <p>
                  <p>friends and I usually go here for lunch and gossip, too. Lots of conversations <p>
                  <p>about boys, death, outer space, and celebrity tea.<p></h6>
