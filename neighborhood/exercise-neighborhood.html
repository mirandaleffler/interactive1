          One of my favorite areas that I often frequent is not necessarily an exact area
at all. It is instead a collection of slightly distant locations that are all
tied to the same memory. All of these places were the most visited locations
between me and my boyfriend when we first met. They are all relatively in the
same place, that being a mix between Walnut Creek and Pleasant Hill. My
boyfriend and I are long distance during the school year so whenever I miss
him, I find it therapeutic to take myself on a driving tour around these areas
to put my mind and heart at ease. Every one of these locations will probably
always hold powerful memories of time spent with him, which may prove
unfortunate when (if! lolâ€¦) we break up, but for now is very comforting and kind
of cute.
