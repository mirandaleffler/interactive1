<h6>One of my favorite areas that I often frequent is not necessarily an exact <p>
  <p>area at all. It is instead a collection of slightly distant locations that <p>
  <p>are all tied to the same memory. All of these places were the most visited <p>
  <p>locations between me and my boyfriend when we first met. They are all <p>
  <p>relatively in the same place, that being a mix between Walnut Creek and <p>
  <p>Pleasant Hill. My boyfriend and I are long distance during the school year <p>
  <p>so whenever I miss him, I find it therapeutic to take myself on a driving <p>
  <p>tour around these areas to put my mind and heart at ease. Every one of <p>
  <p>these locations will probably always hold powerful memories of time spent <p>
  <p>with him, which may prove unfortunate when (if! lolâ€¦) we break up, but for <p>
  <p>now is very comforting and kind of cute.<p><h6>
